#  This file lists mandatory reviewers for this repo, one username per line.
#
#   If you are not on the reviewers list you may only make changes in this repo via a pull request
#   to one or more engineers in this file.
#
#   You are also strongly encouraged to:
#   1. Do a design review with a reviewer before starting to write code for any non-trivial change.
#   2. Think ahead and break up your changes into small pieces (1-2 days of work). Create a 
#       separate review for each one.
#   
#   If you are a reviewer it is your responsibility to provide feedback in a timely manner. It's a good
#   idea to set aside time each morning to look at reviews from the day before.
#   
#   As a reviewer it is also your responsibility to be an enabler rather than a roadblock.
#   Do not just say: "Don't do that". Instead say: "Here is a better way of accomplishing your goal."
